  * You can use skim_with() with a nest list of functions:
     `skim_with(.list = mylist)` or `skim_with(!!!mylist)`
  * More polished display of subtables in default printing.

### BUG FIXES
  * Fix issue with conflict between knitr and skimr versions 
     of kable() that occurred intermittently.

skimr 1.0.2 (2018-04-04)
========================
### NEW FEATURES
  * You can create skimmers with the formula syntax from `rlang`:
    `skim_with(iqr = ~IQR(.x, na.rm = TRUE))`.

### MAJOR CHANGES
  * The median label has been changed to p50 for consistency with 
     the previous changes to p0 and p100. 

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
   * Impovements and corrections to to readme and other documentation.
   * New vignette showing defaults for skimmers and formats.
   * Vector output match data frame output more closely.
   * Add minimum required version for testhat.

### BUG FIXES
  * You can use `skim_with()` to add and remove skimmers at the same time, i.e.
    `skim_with(iqr = IQR, hist = NULL)` works as expected.
  * Histograms work when Inf or -Inf are present.
  * Change seq( ) parameter to length.out to avoid problems with name matching.
  * Summary should not display a data frame name of "." 
    (which occurs when piping begins with the data frame).
