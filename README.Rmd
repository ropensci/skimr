<cite>skimr</cite> provides a frictionless approach to summary statistics which conforms
to the [principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment),
displaying summary statistics the user can skim quickly to understand their
data. It handles different data types and returns a `skim_df` object which can
be included in a pipeline or displayed nicely for the human reader.

## Installation

Version 2 of skimr is under very active development and near release. Version 1 is 
only receiving updates for significant issues. We recommend that new users 
interested in the development version consider installing the v2 branch. 

The current released version of <cite>skimr</cite> can be installed from CRAN. 
If you wish to install the current build of the next release you can do so using the
following:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/skimr")
```
The APIs for this branch should be considered reasonably stable but still
subject to change if an issue is discovered.

To install the version with the most recent changes that have not yet been
incorporated in the master branch (and may not be):

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/skimr", ref = "develop")
```


or for version 2

``` r
devtools::install_github("ropensci/skimr", ref = "v2")
```

Do not rely on APIs from the develop branch.

The v2 branch is the equivalent to the develop branch for Version 2. While subject
to change, we consider the APIs to be those that will be part of the version 2 release.
Please visit the issue tracker for more extensive information about version 2.


## Skim statistics in the console

<cite>skimr</cite>:

- Provides a larger set of statistics than `summary()`, including missing,
complete, n, and sd.
- reports each data type separately.
- handles dates, logicals, and a variety of other types
- supports spark-bar and spark-line based on
[the pillar package](https://github.com/r-lib/pillar).
allows users to customize the statistics included by data type and to 
implement skimming for additional classes.
- works with many Tidyverse features.

### Separates variables by class:  

```{r}
skim(chickwts)
```

### Presentation is in a compact horizontal format: 
```{r}
skim(iris)
```
### Built in support for strings, lists and other column classes

```{r}
skim(dplyr::starwars)
```

### Has a useful summary function
```{r}
skim(iris) %>% summary()
```


### Individual columns can be selected using tidyverse-style selectors

```{r}
skim(iris, Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)
```

### Handles grouped data 

`skim()` can handle data that has been grouped using `dplyr::group_by`.

```{r}
iris %>% dplyr::group_by(Species) %>% skim()
```

## Knitted results

Simply skimming a data frame will produce the horizontal print
layout shown above. When knitting you can also used enhanced rendering
with kable and pander implementations (pander support is deprecated for v2). 

### Options for kable and pander

Enhanced print options are available by piping to `kable()` or `pander()`.
These build on the [pander package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pander)
and the kable function of the [knitr package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=knitr)
These examples show how the enhanced options should appear after 
knitting, however your results may differ (see vignettes for details).

Note that pander support within the package is deprecated for version 2.

### Option for kable. 
Note that the results='asis' chunk option is used and  the
`skimr::` namespace is used to prevent it being
replaced by knitr::kable (which will result in the long skim_df 
object being printed.)

```{r results='asis'}
skim(iris) %>% skimr::kable()
```


### Options for pander

At times you may need `panderOptions('knitr.auto.asis', FALSE)`.

```{r}
skim(iris) %>% pander()
```


## `skim_df` object (long format)

By default `skim()` prints beautifully in the console, but it also produces a
long, tidy-format `skim_df` object that can be computed on. 

```{r}
a <-  skim(chickwts)
dim(a)
```

```{r}
print.data.frame(skim(chickwts))
```

Note that the long skimr object is not supported in version 2.

### Compute on the full `skim_df` object
```{r}
skim(mtcars) %>% dplyr::filter(stat=="hist")
```

## Customizing skimr

Although <cite>skimr</cite> provides opinionated defaults, it is highly customizable.
Users can specify their own statistics, change the formatting of results,
create statistics for new classes and develop skimmers for data structures
that are not data frames.

### Specify your own statistics and classes

Users can specify their own statistics using a list combined with the
`skim_with()` function.  This can support any named class found in
your data.

```{r}
funs <- list(
  iqr = IQR,
  quantile = purrr::partial(quantile, probs = .99)
)

skim_with(numeric = funs, append = FALSE)
skim(iris, Sepal.Length)

# Restore defaults
skim_with_defaults()

```

### Change formatting

<cite>skimr</cite> provides a set of default formats that allow decimals in columns to
be aligned, a reasonable number of decimal places for numeric data, and a 
representation of dates.  Users can view these with `show_formats()` and
modify them with `skim_format()`.

### Skimming other objects

Procedures for developing skim functions for other objects are described in 
the vignette _Supporting additional objects_.

## Limitations of current version

We are aware that there are issues with rendering the inline histograms and
line charts in various contexts, some of which are described below. 

### Support for spark histograms

There are known issues with printing the spark-histogram characters when
printing a data frame. For example, `"▂▅▇"` is printed as
`"<U+2582><U+2585><U+2587>"`. This longstanding problem [originates in
the low-level code](http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Unicode-display-problem-with-data-frames-under-Windows-td4707639.html) for printing dataframes.
While some cases have been addressed, there are, for example, reports of this 
issue in Emacs ESS.

This means that while <cite>skimr</cite> can render the histograms to the console and in
`kable()`, it cannot in other circumstances. This includes:

* rendering a <cite>skimr</cite> data frame within `pander()`
* converting a <cite>skimr</cite> data frame to a vanilla R data frame, but tibbles render
  correctly

One workaround for showing these characters in Windows is to set the CTYPE part
of your locale to Chinese/Japanese/Korean with `Sys.setlocale("LC_CTYPE",
"Chinese")`. These values do show up by default when printing a data-frame
created by `skim()` as a list (`as.list()`) or as a matrix (`as.matrix()`).

### Printing spark histograms and line graphs in knitted documents

Spark-bar and spark-line work in the console, but may not work when you knit
them to a specific document format. The same session that produces a correctly
rendered HTML document may produce an incorrectly rendered PDF, for example.
This issue can generally be addressed by changing fonts to one with good
building block (for histograms) and Braille support (for line graphs). For
example, the open font "DejaVu Sans" from the `extrafont` package supports
these. You may also want to try wrapping your results in `knitr::kable()`.
Please see the vignette on using fonts for details.

Displays in documents of different types will vary. For example, one user found
that the font "Yu Gothic UI Semilight" produced consistent results for
Microsoft Word and Libre Office Write.

## Contributing

We welcome issue reports and pull requests, including potentially adding
support for commonly used variable classes. However, in general, we encourage
users to take advantage of <cite>skimr</cite>'s flexibility to add their own customized
classes. Please see the 
[contributing](https://ropensci.github.io/skimr/CONTRIBUTING.html) and
[conduct](https://ropensci.github.io/skimr/CONDUCT.html) documents.
