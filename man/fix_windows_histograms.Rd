\description{
This functions changes your session's locale to address issues with printing
histograms on Windows on versions of R below 4.2.1.
}
\details{
There are known issues with printing the spark-histogram characters when
printing a data frame, appearing like this: "<U+2582><U+2585><U+2587>".
This longstanding problem originates in the low-level code for printing
dataframes. This was addressed in R version 4.2.1.
